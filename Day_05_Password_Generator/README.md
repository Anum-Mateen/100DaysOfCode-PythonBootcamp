# 🔐 Day 05 - Password Generator

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **Password Generator** that creates secure, randomized passwords based on user preferences.

The program asks the user:

- **How many letters** they want in the password  
- **How many symbols** to include  
- **How many numbers** to include  

It then randomly selects characters from each category, shuffles them for extra randomness, and displays the final secure password.

This is the fifth project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu**, helping you practice **lists**, **loops**, and **randomisation**.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Creating and working with **lists** in Python  
- Using the `random.choice()` method to select random elements  
- Using the `random.shuffle()` method to randomize order  
- Iterating over lists with `for` loops  
- Taking numeric input with `int()`  
- Building strings dynamically from lists  
- Writing both "easy" and "hard" versions of the program for better security
