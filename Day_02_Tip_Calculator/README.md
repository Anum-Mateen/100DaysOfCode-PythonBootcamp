# ðŸ’¸ Day 02 - Tip Calculator

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a simple **Tip Calculator** that takes:

- The **total bill amount**
- The **tip percentage** the user wants to give
- The **number of people** splitting the bill

It then calculates how much **each person** should pay, including the tip, formatted to **2 decimal places** for accuracy.

This is the second project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu**, helping you practice user input, type conversion, and math operations.
