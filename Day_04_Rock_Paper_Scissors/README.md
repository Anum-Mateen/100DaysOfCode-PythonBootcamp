# ✊📄✂️ Day 04 - Rock, Paper, Scissors

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where the player competes against the computer.

The program:

- Displays ASCII art for **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**
- Takes the user's choice as input
- Randomly selects the computer's choice
- Compares both choices and determines the winner

This is the fourth project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu**, helping you practice **randomisation**, **lists**, and **conditional statements**.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Using the `random` module to generate random integers
- Storing ASCII art in variables for a better game experience
- Organizing game options inside a Python **list**
- Handling invalid user inputs with conditional checks
- Implementing **if-elif-else** logic for multiple outcomes
- Creating a fun, interactive text-based game
